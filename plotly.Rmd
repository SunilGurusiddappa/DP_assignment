####Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("yahoo.r")
AAPL<-GetYahooData("AAPL")
IBM<-GetYahooData("IBM")


library(plotly)

mat<-data.frame(Date=AAPL$Date,AAPL=round(AAPL$Adj.Close,2),IBM=round(IBM$Adj.Close,2) )

p <- mat %>% 
  plot_ly(x = AAPL$Date, y = AAPL, fill = "tozeroy", name = "Microsoft") %>% 
  add_trace(y = IBM, fill = "tonexty", name = "IBM") %>% 
  layout(title = "Stock Prices", 
         xaxis = list(title = "Time"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Stock Prices"))
p  # Thats it !
